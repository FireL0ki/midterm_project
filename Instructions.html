<!--
    For this project, create a client side website that collects and uses data from an API. 
    You will write your own original HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Please see the project suggestions provided, or propose your own idea. 
If working on your own idea, please discuss with me before you start to ensure your 
project meets the complexity requirements for the project. 
If you are working on one of the suggested projects, please discuss your ideas for how you will build the project.

Your site must use CSS and JavaScript in a meaningful way. 
But, if you like, you may focus more on either CSS and design to style and present 
the data from the API. Or, you may focus more on JavaScript to process the data, 
or make multiple or more complex API queries to obtain more detailed data. 

Using Bootstrap is optional. 

You should publish your site using GitHub pages.

You should discuss your project with me before you begin to make sure it meets the requirements for the project. 
You should use CSS of your own design to lay out and style your components. 
You can use color, fonts, text decorations, text alignment. 
Use margins, borders, padding and/or other styles for your elements. 
You should use JavaScript to collect data from the API. 
Your code should be organized, logical, handle errors, 
and you should have tested it thoroughly.

Project organization: use external CSS and JavaScript files for your page. 
Focus on writing correct JS and well-formed CSS and HTML, 
indent your files correctly, fix editor warnings, use descriptive variable names, 
comment your work

HTML/CSS/JS quality is important. 
Aim for a well-written project with neat, organized, readable code, HTML and CSS.
Only use images and other resources that you have permission to use; 
either your own resources or use public domain images.  
You'll be putting your site online so definitely ensure you have permission 
to re-use any images or other media.

To submit - these THREE things:

1. One zip file containing ALL of your files and resources.  
NO 7-Zip or other archive formats - ZIP ONLY

2.The link to a repository containing all of your project files/resources

3. Your site should be live online using GitHub Pages.  
So include a link to your GitHub homepage. How? 
Enabling GitHub Pages for a Repository.


Additional Note: 
Choose an API which is free and open, and doesn't need authentication or a key to use, 
and uses https not http. Only https will work with GitHub pages.

Bonus feature: would it be helpful to store data for your page? 
Local Storage can help. Store key-value pairs.
